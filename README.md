## Deployment

This project was deployed to Heroku, a cloud platform that enables companies to build, deliver, monitor, and scale apps. To set up the project, I utilized the Code Institute GitPod full template and installed Django and the necessary packages/libraries using the following commands in the GitPod terminal:

```
pip3 install Django==3.2 gunicorn
pip3 install dj3-cloudinary-storage
pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt
```

### Deployment of This Project

To deploy this project, follow these steps:

1. Log in to Heroku or create a new account.
2. On the main page, click "New" in the top right corner and select "Create New App" from the drop-down menu.
3. Enter a unique app name and select your region.
4. Click "Create App" to proceed.
5. In the resources section, select "Heroku Postgres" as the database.
6. Click "Reveal Config Vars" and add a new record with the key "SECRET_KEY".
7. Click "Reveal Config Vars" again and add a new record with the key "CLOUDINARY_URL".
8. Click "Reveal Config Vars" once more and add a new record with the key "DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC" and value "1".
9. Go to the project's Deploy Tab and scroll down to the Settings Tab.
10. In the Config Vars section, add the necessary environment variables.
11. Scroll down to the Buildpack section and click "Add Buildpack". Select "Python" and save the changes.
12. Go back to the Deploy tab and choose "GitHub" as the deployment method.

15. Enable Automatic Deploys if you want the project to be automatically deployed when pushing updates to GitHub.


### Final Deployment

To successfully deploy your project, follow these steps:

1. Create a Procfile by running the command `web: gunicorn your_project_name.wsgi` in your project directory. This file tells Heroku how to run your application.

2. Once your development is complete, change the `DEBUG` setting to `False` in your `settings.py` file. This ensures that your application runs in production mode and provides better security.

3. In your Heroku settings, delete the `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` config vars. This allows Heroku to collect and serve your static files automatically.

By following these steps, you will have a smooth and successful deployment of your project on Heroku.
